# WS2812B_diod_strip_programming
<h2> Diod Strip programming project for POC course.</h2>

The final goal of our project is to create an interactive clothes for bicycle riders : including diod strip on clothes, which will be lighted on depending on the acceleration of rider.

Future goal : make accelerator connected with strip via Bluetooth module.

Current project components:
